# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
The goal of this project was to develop a model that predicts the survival of passengers based on various factors. 
Utilizing logistic regression, a powerful statistical technique, I constructed a predictive model that takes into account factors such as Age, Sex, Pclass, and more, to estimate the likelihood of survival for individual passengers.
By analyzing the available data from the Titanic`s passenger list, I was able to train the model to make accurate predictions.
